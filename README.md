Using the API
=============

The APIs support REST-formatted requests. Responses are returned in JSON or XML format, depending upon the content type specified in the request header.

* JSON Response = Content-Type:application/json
* XML Response = Content-Type:text/json

In this folder are sample snippets of code that access the [ARMS](http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/arms-farm-financial-and-crop-production-practices.aspx) API with Ruby, Python and jQuery.
